## Introduction

This project formed out of the [Udacity](https://udacity.com/) [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). It display the classic game "Memory".

## How to play

Once the page is loaded the game is ready to start. 16 face-down shuffled cards will be shown, each holding one of 8 symbols.
The goal is to match pairs with the same symbol.

Just by clicking a card, it will turn around and reveal it's symbol. After 2 cards are revealed they are checked for match.
If the symbols match, they stay revealed, if not, the cards will be turned over again.

Once all cards have been matched, the game is won.

The amount of moves and the time needed to complete the game will be shown. Also, there is a star-rating rating the player's performance
on how many moves were needed to win.
